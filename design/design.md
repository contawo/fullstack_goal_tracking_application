# Goal tracking design
When designing this application I need to always keep in mind about the design requirements. It is important to deign for a purpose and also understand the user's preferences.

## Requirements
These are the main requirements for the application.
- [ ] The user must be authenticated to create goals.
- [ ] The user must be able to create a main goal
- [ ] Within the main goal, the user must also be able to create a sub-goal
- [ ] The user must get a notification both on the app and via email when a goal is overdue.
- [ ] A user must be able to manage the todos by creating, updating (completed) and deleting the todo.
- [ ] A user must be able to view and update their information such as:
    - Email
    - Username
    - Billing information
- [ ] The application will have two plans that a user will have to choose:
    - Free: Storing all the data locally and receiving notifications via the application
    - Paid: All the data is stored in the database.

### Additional requirements
These are not neccessary needed but if they are there it is a plus.
- [ ] User dashboard to manage and view all the goals.
- [ ] Animations to create an amazing experience for the user.
- [ ] The application must have both light and dark theme.

## Pages
These are the pages that the application will be having based on the requirements stated above.
1. Settings page
2. Dashboard page
3. New goal page (Can also be a popup)
4. Goal page
5. Notifications page (Can also be a popup)

### Settings page
This will be a page where the user will be able to:
- Manage and view user information
- Toggle between light and dark theme

### Dashboard page
This will be the home page. I thought of creating a landing page instead but this will be time consuming when it comes to the user and this is a goal tracking application, not much on-boarding or application tutorial needed. I will have a video that demonstrates the application though for first time users.
This will be a page where users can:
- View all the main goals (also click on them)
- Create a new main goal. I think I will create a page for this instead of a popup.

### Navigation side bar
This will allow the user to navigate through the application seemlessily. This will have:
- All the pages links
- This will also have all the main goals so that a user can easily access them without having to go to the dashboard page.

### Notifications page
This is the page where the user will be able to view all the notifications. They will be able to toggle them once read to mark as read.
You know what, let me make this as a popup instead. This will be situated on the Goal page header.

### Goal page
Each main goal will have it's own page where the user can manage sub-goals based on the requirements stated above.
