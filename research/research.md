# Goals tracking application
The idea is to create a goals tracking application that allows user to:
1. Set main goals.
2. Create sub-goals to accomplish the main goal.
3. Manage all the goals by creation, deleting, updating and viewing.
4. Receive a notification email when a goal is overdue.
I want to make this application as simple as possible. I will add features there and there.

## Who is this application made for?
Any developer or young professional that wants to increase their productivity by trasking their goals. This will also help them aware of their progress.

## Monetization
For user to use application there will be two options:
1. Use the application locally, meaning changes will not be saved on the database.
2. Pay a very low monthly subscription, because this is just a side project, to store the data on the database.

## Reasons for creating this application
I am creating this application for education purposes, just to increase my skills in programming and creating software. Hence, this project will be completely open source. I will documents everything I did in detail.
Also I have been looking for a specific goal tracking application that has the features I want. The nice thing about being a developer is that you can create these things, with the exact features you want.

## Competitors for inspiration
1. [GoalsOnTrack](https://www.goalsontrack.com/): They have habit tracking, goal tracking, journals, tasks etc.
2. Todo applications [Todoist](https://todoist.com/templates/goal-tracker): Most of these todo application have a goal tracking feature in them.

## Coming soon features
At a later stage I am planning on adding more features, like:

- [ ] Invite another user on a goal
- [ ] Share goals on social media for content 
- [ ] Invite people as an affiliate

## Things to consider
- I must consider scalability.
- I must also consider performance.
